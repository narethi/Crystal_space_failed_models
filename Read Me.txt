This is the last version of the crystal space project I had worked on before I decided to try to integrate it
into the crystal space architecture. You will notice that the planes are not attached in the terrain generator
I just never got around to fixing that bug (stitching the planes together by interpolating the shared points on
the edges of the planes)
